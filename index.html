                Hello, 
                <br />
                Welcome to my portfolio.  I am so glad you stopped by.  I am Kate, a highly self-motivated and hard-working individual who also enjoys teamwork and collaboration.  I am looking to apply my technological abilities in web development, mobile development, and extensive content creation experience to help companies go above and beyond their marketing, communications, and branding objectives.  
                <br />
                Here is my portfolio of many professional projects including augmented reality and virtual reality marketing experiences, advertorial content, and games.  I am an extended reality (XR) developer and well-versed in the full-stack of multiple web and mobile programming languages.
